## Telecom Churn Analysis

📊 Exploring Telecom Customer Churn Patterns 🚀

## Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my first data science project, a comprehensive analysis of Telecom Customer Churn. As a recent graduate in Telecommunication Engineering with a passion for data science, I delved into this project to understand why customers leave a telecommunications service provider and how these insights can benefit the industry.

## Key Highlights:

📈 Investigated customer churn patterns in a dataset comprising 7,043 customer records from a California-based Telecom company in Q2 2022.

🔍 Explored demographics, subscription services, tenure, and more to identify factors influencing churn.

🛠️ Utilized Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium for data analysis and visualization.

📌 Developed recommendations for improving customer retention strategies in the telecom industry.
